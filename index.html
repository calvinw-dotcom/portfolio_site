        <p>Hello, I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for solving problems. I was most recently a corporate tax advisor, but after spending 3 and a bit years in the role I am looking to make the jump into tech. I am currently a volunteer web-dev for a charity in East London.</p>

                    Nommo2 is a Django-based web application that provides a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service. Users can input URLs, and the system generates MP3 audio files from the text using backend logic. It features user authentication, a dashboard, and request tracking. Built due to frustration that I could not read news articles in the gym, this webapp was my chance to build on my understanding python and put my, at the time, newly acquired knowledge of Django to use.

                    This project was also an opportunity to experiment with AI and learn not only its capabilities but, more importantly, its limitations, particularly regarding hardware limitations and biases of the creators. As I chose to ride the deep-seek “wave”, this tool may not accurately represent certain articles, particularly those relating to a certain student-led protest in 1989. Also, as this developed on a laptop with not so spectacular graphics card, the is a bit of a delay in receiving the requested article MP3 file.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Version one used the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the article and return the distilled content. I initially optimised this for BBC news articles, for which I had received permission from the bbc. Once I had this running, I tried using AI to allow the application to scrape text regardless of the HTML structure. However, due to various restrictions in sites’ robots.txt files, this proved difficult to implement. As such, I pivoted to make Nommo2 a news summariser as well as a TTS app

                During my first few weeks as a tax advisor, I was asked by a Director to calculate the income tax and national insurance contributions of a list of a client’s employees. As this as a time consuming and repetitive task, I saw it as an opportunity to put me new coding skills to use and automate. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Originally, this was a simple script but as I developed my understanding of python and best practices, I went back and split the logic into functions. Looking back, I would have sped up the task by reading directly from the excel file containing the necessary information and writing the PAYE and NIC contributions back to that same file. However, I have chosen not to make any further changes so I can preserve my code to look back on.</p>

                <p class="hidden-content">
                    Wanting to be somewhat helpful from the start, I thought building a website, albeit fairly basic, would be the best way to get up to speed with HTML and CSS, and also learn the basics of JavaScript.

                    This is my first time having the chance to work on a live production environment and a completely new tech stack, which has given me a better understnaing of the pros and cons of differnt languages and frameworks, most recently the advantages of asynchronous programming that JavaScript can bring.

                    So far, my contributions have the maintenance of the current website, accessability enhancements and other front end adjustments. Once I have cleared the issues assigned to me, I will begin assisting with the development of the new webiste!

                    This was my first experience building something as part of a team, and I learnt a lot about planning projects, architecture, and differnet frameworks (I worked on the backend and building some dummy APIs to be used in the demo). I also learnt a lot about the soft skills needed to code as part of a team and the importance of version control (and just how to use it).
